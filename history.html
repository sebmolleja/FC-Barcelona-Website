            <p> One of the most famous and successful football clubs of all time, FC Barcelona, 
                has been a staple organization in the sporting world. Here we take a brief look at 
                the history and story of the club.<br>
                <br>The roots of the club began at the start of the 20th century, 
                when a Swiss man named Hans Gamper moved to Barcelona. Gamper 
                would occasionally play football with his friends in his free time and 
                eventually placed an advert  in a local paper to find more players interested in 
                forming a football team. Soon enough, Gamper and 11 other men formed the first
                Barcelona football team in 1909. They played at the Camp de la Industria pitch
                which became the first grounds and stadium of the club.<br>
                <br>Being from the Catalan region, the team switched its official language from Spanish to Catalan 
                in hopes to represent the region through the club and create an identity for its 
                members and supporters. This allowed for there to be a membership to the club which 
                meant entry into the Catalan community. Hence the club's motto, ‘Mes que un club’, ‘More 
                than a club’.

            </div>

            <p>The time around the Spanish Civil War was a rough period for the club as the 
                players and supporters were undoubtedly going to be involved with the events 
                that took place. Majority of the FC Barcelona members were against the political
                ideology of Falangism and the Falangist movement as a whole which led to a horrific 
                attack that resulted in the club's president to be murdered by opposing soldiers. 
                Due to these events, the catalan language, flag, and all their symbols were banned.
                In addition, the club was forced to change their name to 
                ‘Club de Futbol Barcelona’ during this time.<br>
                  <br>Even under political constraints the club's members and supporters still 
                showed their pro-independence and anti-Franco beliefs. Throughout these hard times 
                the team still enjoyed their success during the 1950s but difficult times came ahead 
                in the 60s due to the debt they were in after building the new stadium in 1957.
                This meant the club had very little funds to attract and buy new players.
                However, in the 70s the club slowly revived their financial situation which
                allowed them to buy some of the world's greatest players like Johann Cruyff 
                who was signed in 1973 and Diego Maradona who was signed in 1982. These stars 
                and icons of the game gave more royalty to FC Barcelona and boosted 
                its reputation among the sporting world.

            <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">An Important Transition</h1>

            <p>There has never been a more important era for FC Barcelona than the 90s. 
                During this time Barca legend Johan Cruyff returned to the club but this time as a 
                manager. While this was occurring the club decided to invest in an old farm house 
                accompanied with land which would become the training ground and facilities for the 
                FC Barcelona youth program “La Masia”. The first set of La Masia graduates were 
                corresponding with the arrival of Johan Cruyff as manager and this was pivotal 
                for the football ideologies of the club. Some of these graduates included Pep Guardiola
                and Luis Enrique who would later become some of the most successful managers for the 
                club. The first team which was led by cruyff revolutionized the Barca tactics. Cruyff’s
                ideas would translate to a philosophy called ‘Total Football’ a style of play and ideas
                that would allow all players to have freedom and move across the pitch while covering 
                for each other and keeping a back end structure. This became the FC Barcelona 
                way that would carry on throughout the clubs most dominant years.

            </div>

            <p> With the upsurge in the clubs success Barcelona gave themselves a unique style and 
                reputation in the football world. During Cruyff’s time as manager the team managed to 
                win the La Liga consecutively for four years (1991-1994). They also won the European 
                Cup in 1992 and the Spanish League Cup (Copa Del Rey) in 1990. These titles would push 
                Cruyff to become one of the most treasured and elite managers of all time. Unfortunately, 
                Johan Cruyff passed away in 2016 but his legacy lives on through football fans across the world.

            <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Reaching The Top</h1>

            <p> The team's success has not slowed down as they have won a total of 24 La Liga titles, 
                5 UEFA Championships, and 28 Copa Del Reys. More academy graduates proved to be the 
                answer to the club’s major success as La Masia created numerous world class players
                such as Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Xavi Hernandez, Carles Puyol, Sergio Busquests,
                and Gerard Pique.<br>
                <br>
                One of the main differences with FC Barcelona is they are one of the only clubs in the 
                world that are owned by the club's members. Many of the big teams are usually owned by rich 
                investors but Barcelona’s membership is what makes up their ownership. Each member is called
                a socis and there are a total of 143,000 of them who make decisions such as electing the 
                club president. Along with this, the club is run through the money made with games, 
                merchandise, ticket sales, television rights, etc. With these methods FC Barcelona is
                one of the richest football clubs in the world.
