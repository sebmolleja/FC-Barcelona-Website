        <p> The Camp Nou is the current stadium of FC Barcelona. It was built in 1954 and took
            3 years to complete. It was designed by the architects Francesc Mitjans Miró, 
            Josep Soteras Mauri, and Lorenzo García Barbón. It officially opened on the 
            24th of September hosting a game between FC Barcelona and a selection of players
            from Warsaw, Poland. The Camp Nou replaced the old grounds of the club called 
            “Les Corts” which only had a capacity of 48,000. Les Corts was considered to be
            too small for the amount of interest that the club was gaining.

        <p> The stadium was originally supposed to be named ‘Estadi del Fc Barcelona’ which translates
            to the ‘FC Barcelona Stadium’ but it began gaining traction as the ‘Camp Nou’ which means 
            the ‘New ground’. In the 2000/2001 season, a vote made by the club membership was 
            conducted to officially make the stadium's name ‘Camp Nou’.<br><br>
            The Camp Nou has a total capacity of 99,354 which puts it as the biggest stadium in Europe. 
            It has a maximum height of 48 meters and covers a total surface area of 55,000 square meters.
            Originally when it first opened it held 93,053 spectators which then increased to 120,000 
            for the FIFA World Cup but due to the new regulation of stadium capacities, it decreased
            to 99,000 in the late 90s.<br><br>
            Some notable matches that the Camp Nou has hosted include the European Cup final in 1989 
            between AC Milan and FC Steaua and then the Champions League final
            in 1999 between Manchester United and FC Bayern.

        <p>In comparison to other stadiums, the Camp Nou has not had many renovations over the years which makes
            it lack many of the modern facilities that the majority of stadiums carry these days.
            Therefore, for the last decade the Camp Nou has been 
            evaluated for a massive renovation or even a completely new build.<br><br>
            In the mid 2000s, the club presented plans for a renovated Camp Nou, 
            but due to a lack of funding plans were backtracked. 
            The club head offices were contemplating moving to new grounds 
            but decided to renovate the current stadium in the future.<br><br>
            To this day the stadium is still being evaluated with plans on making 
            a modern renovation to the current stadium which will take place over 
            the next decade. In addition, with the new Spotify sponsor deal signed 
            in 2022, there were agreements reached to rename the stadium as the ‘Spotify Camp Nou’.
